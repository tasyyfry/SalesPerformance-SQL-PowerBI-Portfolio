# SalesPerformance-SQL-PowerBI-Portfolio
## Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of a Sales Performance Dashboard using Power BI and SQL Server, utilizing a comprehensive sales dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to provide a robust analytical tool for stakeholders to monitor and evaluate sales performance, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions.

## Introduction
The Sales Performance Dashboard project aims to visualize sales data effectively. By using Power BI for visualization and SQL Server for data management, I create an interactive and dynamic dashboard that provides comprehensive insights into sales performance.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle. It contains various sales-related attributes such as sales amount, product categories, dates, and customer information.
Dataset Source: Kaggle Sales Data

## Data Preparation
- Data Import: Import the dataset into SQL Server.
- Data Cleaning: Perform necessary data cleaning operations such as handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates.
- Data Transformation: Create additional calculated columns or tables if necessary, to support the dashboard requirements.

## Key Visuals on the Dashboard

- Sales Trend each month: a bar chart for total sales by month indicates monthly sales trends, helping to identify peak and low sales periods.
- Top Products: Bar chart highlighting top-selling sub products.
- Sales by Region: The bar chart showing the sum of sales by state provides insights into regional sales distribution, identifying the highest and lowest performing states. Another bar chart highlights the top 5 sub-categories by sales quantity, emphasizing the most popular product segments.
- Sales Performance: KPIs showing key metrics like total sales, average sales, and growth rate.
- Category Trend : A pie chart illustrates the total quantity sold by category, giving a clear breakdown of sales across different product types. The combination of a line and bar chart for total sales and profit by quarter visualizes trends and comparisons over different quarters. 
- Correlation Quantity and Profit: A scatter plot demonstrates the correlation between quantity sold and profit by order month, revealing patterns and relationships between these variables.
- Profit Trend : a line chart shows total profit by year and category, tracking profit trends over multiple years and across different product categories.
